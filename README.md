#Basic CSS Trigonometry Playground

Fed up working with magic numbers in CSS?
I started learning some high-school math formulas and implementing them in CSS with SASS. The idea is to start using some real math formulas in future CSS projects.

##Getting Started

* Clone the repo
* Run `npm install gulp`
* Run `npm install`
* Have fun
